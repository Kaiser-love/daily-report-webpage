# OpenAI teams using Codex AI to build apps, humans no longer needed to write software
## OpenAI says one of its teams has built an app with zero human-written code. Every single line of code in this app has come from Codex AI agents, notes the company in a blog post, highlighting that software developers may no longer be needed to write code in future.

A Chinese government hacking group that has been sanctioned for targeting America's critical infrastructure used Google's AI chatbot, Gemini, to auto-analyze vulnerabilities and plan cyberattacks against US organizations, the company says.
While there's no indication that any of these attacks were successful, "APT groups like this continue to experiment with adopting AI to support semi-autonomous offensive operations,"Â Google Threat Intelligence Group chief analyst John Hultquist told*The Register*. "We anticipate that China-based actors in particular will continue to build agentic approaches for cyber offensive scale."
In the threat-intel group's most recent[AI Threat Tracker report], released on Thursday and shared with*The Register*in advance, Google attributes this activity to APT31, a Beijing-backed crew also known as Violet Typhoon, Zirconium, and Judgment Panda.
This goon squad was one of many[exploiting a series of Microsoft SharePoint bugs] over the summer, and in March 2024, the US[issued sanctions against] and criminally charged seven APT31 members accused of breaking into computer networks, email accounts, and cloud storage belonging to numerous high-value targets.
The most recent attempts by APT31 to use Google's Gemini AI tool happened late last year, we're t

Claude AI

- Anthropic aims to attract users preferring subscriptions over ad-supported AI
- Free users can generate Excel, PowerPoint, Word, and PDF files in Claude
- Claude's free tier now allows file creation, connectors, and skills access

Did our AI summary help?

Anthropic said on Tuesday that users on Claudeâ€™s free tier can now create files, connect external apps and use skills, features that were previously reserved for paying customers. The change deepens the companyâ€™s push to attract users who are wary of ad-supported AI products, even as rivals experiment with new monetisation models.

Free users can now create, edit and work with files directly inside a Claude conversation using the Sonnet 4.5 model. While Pro subscribers still get access to the more capable Opus model, the free tier can generate Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Word documents and PDFs, turn

# AI Can Now â€˜knowâ€™ When Itâ€™s About to Fail before Answering Questions
![RohailÂ T.]

[![Quantum Computer Resilience Boosted by New â€˜restartâ€™ Technology for Complex Simulations]] 
Researchers are increasingly focused on optimising the computational cost of large language models (LLMs) during complex reasoning tasks. William Lugoloobi, Thomas Foster, and William Bankes, from the University of Oxford and University College London, alongside Chris Russell et al., demonstrate that LLMs internally encode information about their likely success*before*generating an answer. This research is significant because it reveals that pre-generation activations can be used to predict performance on mathematical and other tasks, exceeding the predictive power of traditional features like question length. By analysing model performance on the E2H-AMC benchmark, the team show that LLMs develop a unique sense of difficulty, differing from human perception, and crucially, that this internal assessment improves with more extensive reasoning. Ultimately, they prove that utilising these internal signals allows for intelligent query routing, achieving performance gains of up to 70% cost reduction on the MATH dataset.
### Pre-generation activations reveal internal self-assessment of problem-solving potential in large language models
Researchers have discovered that large language models internally assess their own likelihood of success before generating outputs. This breakthrough addresses a critical challenge in the field: efficiently allocating computational resources to problems that genuinely require them. The study demonstrates th

# OpenAI teams using Codex AI to build apps, humans no longer needed to write software
## OpenAI says one of its teams has built an app with zero human-written code. Every single line of code in this app has come from Codex AI agents, notes the company in a blog post, highlighting that software developers may no longer be needed to write code in future.

A Chinese government hacking group that has been sanctioned for targeting America's critical infrastructure used Google's AI chatbot, Gemini, to auto-analyze vulnerabilities and plan cyberattacks against US organizations, the company says.
While there's no indication that any of these attacks were successful, "APT groups like this continue to experiment with adopting AI to support semi-autonomous offensive operations,"Â Google Threat Intelligence Group chief analyst John Hultquist told*The Register*. "We anticipate that China-based actors in particular will continue to build agentic approaches for cyber offensive scale."
In the threat-intel group's most recent[AI Threat Tracker report], released on Thursday and shared with*The Register*in advance, Google attributes this activity to APT31, a Beijing-backed crew also known as Violet Typhoon, Zirconium, and Judgment Panda.
This goon squad was one of many[exploiting a series of Microsoft SharePoint bugs] over the summer, and in March 2024, the US[issued sanctions against] and criminally charged seven APT31 members accused of breaking into computer networks, email accounts, and cloud storage belonging to numerous high-value targets.

# Anthropic makes its move on ChatGPT as it opens Claudeâ€™s core tools to free users

## Anthropic is widening the gap between Claude and ad-funded chatbots. The company has unlocked file creation, third-party connectors and skills for free users, extending a strategy aimed squarely at people who want useful AI without adverts.

Claude AI

- Anthropic aims to attract users preferring subscriptions over ad-supported AI
- Free users can generate Excel, PowerPoint, Word, and PDF files in Claude
- Claude's free tier now allows file creation, connectors, and skills access

Did our AI summary help?

Anthropic said on Tuesday that users on Claudeâ€™s free tier can now create files, connect external apps and use skills, features that were previously reserved for paying customers. The change deepens the companyâ€™s push to attract users who are wary of ad-supported AI products, even as rivals experiment with new monetisation models.

Free users can now create, edit and work with files directly inside a Claude conversation using the Sonnet 4.5 model. While Pro subscribers still get access to the more capable Opus model, the free tier can generate Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Word documents and PDFs, turn

Researchers are increasingly focused on optimising the computational cost of large language models (LLMs) during complex reasoning tasks. William Lugoloobi, Thomas Foster, and William Bankes, from the University of Oxford and University College London, alongside Chris Russell et al., demonstrate that LLMs internally encode information about their likely success*before*generating an answer. This research is significant because it reveals that pre-generation activations can be used to predict performance on mathematical and other tasks, exceeding the predictive power of traditional features like question length. By analysing model performance on the E2H-AMC benchmark, the team show that LLMs develop a unique sense of difficulty, differing from human perception, and crucially, that this internal assessment improves with more extensive reasoning. Ultimately, they prove that utilising these internal signals allows for intelligent query routing, achieving performance gains of up to 70% cost reduction on the MATH dataset.
### Pre-generation activations reveal internal self-assessment of problem-solving potential in large language models

# AI Can Now â€˜knowâ€™ When Itâ€™s About to Fail before Answering Questions

Researchers are increasingly focused on optimising the computational cost of large language models (LLMs) during complex reasoning tasks. William Lugoloobi, Thomas Foster, and William Bankes, from the University of Oxford and University College London, alongside Chris Russell et al., demonstrate that LLMs internally encode information about their likely success*before*generating an answer. This research is significant because it reveals that pre-generation activations can be used to predict performance on mathematical and other tasks, exceeding the predictive power of traditional features like question length. By analysing model performance on the E2H-AMC benchmark, the team show that LLMs develop a unique sense of difficulty, differing from human perception, and crucially, that this internal assessment improves with more extensive reasoning. Ultimately, they prove that utilising these internal signals allows for intelligent query routing, achieving performance gains of up to 70% cost reduction on the MATH dataset.
### Pre-generation activations reveal internal self-assessment of problem-solving potential in large language models
Researchers have discovered that large language models internally assess their own likelihood of success before generating outputs. This breakthrough addresses a critical challenge in the field: efficiently allocating computational resources to problems that genuinely require them. The study demonstrates th
