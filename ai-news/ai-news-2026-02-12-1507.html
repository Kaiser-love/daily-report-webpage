# Google: China's APT31 used Gemini to plan cyberattacks against US orgs

## Meanwhile, IP-stealing 'distillation attacks' on the rise

Thu 12 Feb 2026 // 07:00 UTC

A Chinese government hacking group that has been sanctioned for targeting America's critical infrastructure used Google's AI chatbot, Gemini, to auto-analyze vulnerabilities and plan cyberattacks against US organizations, the company says.

While there's no indication that any of these attacks were successful, "APT groups like this continue to experiment with adopting AI to support semi-autonomous offensive operations," Google Threat Intelligence Group chief analyst John Hultquist told The Register. "We anticipate that China-based actors in particular will continue to build agentic approaches for cyber offensive scale."

In the threat-intel group's most recent [AI Threat Tracker report], released on Thursday and shared with The Register in advance, Google attributes this activity to APT31, a Beijing-backed crew also known as Violet Typhoon, Zirconium, and Judgment Panda.

This goon squad was one of many [exploiting a series of Microsoft SharePoint bugs] over the summer, and in March 2024, the US [issued sanctions against] and criminally charged seven APT31 members accused of breaking into computer networks, email accounts, and cloud storage belonging to numerous high-value targets.

The most recent attempts by APT31 to use Google's Gemini AI tool happened late last year, we're told.

"APT31 employed a highly structured approach by prompting Gemini with an expert cybersecurity persona to

Text: AI Can Now â€˜knowâ€™ When Itâ€™s About To Fail Before Answering Questions

Researchers are increasingly focused on optimising the computational cost of large language models (LLMs) during complex reasoning tasks. William Lugoloobi, Thomas Foster, and William Bankes, from the University of Oxford and University College London, alongside Chris Russell et al., demonstrate that LLMs internally encode information about their likely success before generating an answer. This research is significant because it reveals that pre-generation activations can be used to predict performance on mathematical and other tasks, exceeding the predictive power of traditional features like question length. By analysing model performance on the E2H-AMC benchmark, the team show that LLMs develop a unique sense of difficulty, differing from human perception, and crucially, that this internal assessment improves with more extensive reasoning. Ultimately, they prove that utilising these internal signals allows for intelligent query routing, achieving performance gains of up to 70% cost reduction on the MATH dataset.

### Pre-generation activations reveal internal self-assessment of problem-solving potential in large language models

Researchers have discovered that large language models internally assess their own likelihood of success before generating outputs. This breakthrough addresses a critical challenge in the field: efficiently allocating computational resources to problems that genuinely require them. The study demonstrates that these internal assessments, encoded within the modelsâ€™ pre-generation activations, can be accurately predicted using linear probes.

These probes substantially outperform traditional features like question length or term frequency-inverse document frequency in predictin

# Google: China's APT31 used Gemini to plan cyberattacks against US orgs

## Meanwhile, IP-stealing 'distillation attacks' on the rise

Thu 12 Feb 2026 // 07:00 UTC

A Chinese government hacking group that has been sanctioned for targeting America's critical infrastructure used Google's AI chatbot, Gemini, to auto-analyze vulnerabilities and plan cyberattacks against US organizations, the company says.

While there's no indication that any of these attacks were successful, "APT groups like this continue to experiment with adopting AI to support semi-autonomous offensive operations," Google Threat Intelligence Group chief analyst John Hultquist told The Register. "We anticipate that China-based actors in particular will continue to build agentic approaches for cyber offensive scale."

In the threat-intel group's most recent [AI Threat Tracker report], released on Thursday and shared with The Register in advance, Google attributes this activity to APT31, a Beijing-backed crew also known as Violet Typhoon, Zirconium, and Judgment Panda.

This goon squad was one of many [exploiting a series of Microsoft SharePoint bugs] over the summer, and in March 2024, the US [issued sanctions against] and criminally charged seven APT31 members accused of breaking into computer networks, email accounts, and cloud storage belonging to numerous high-value targets.

The most recent attempts by APT31 to use Google's Gemini AI tool happened late last year, we're told.

Text: AI Can Now â€˜knowâ€™ When Itâ€™s About To Fail Before Answering Questions

Researchers are increasingly focused on optimising the computational cost of large language models (LLMs) during complex reasoning tasks. William Lugoloobi, Thomas Foster, and William Bankes, from the University of Oxford and University College London, alongside Chris Russell et al., demonstrate that LLMs internally encode information about their likely success before generating an answer. This research is significant because it reveals that pre-generation activations can be used to predict performance on mathematical and other tasks, exceeding the predictive power of traditional features like question length. By analysing model performance on the E2H-AMC benchmark, the team show that LLMs develop a unique sense of difficulty, differing from human perception, and crucially, that this internal assessment improves with more extensive reasoning. Ultimately, they prove that utilising these internal signals allows for intelligent query routing, achieving performance gains of up to 70% cost reduction on the MATH dataset.

### Pre-generation activations reveal internal self-assessment of problem-solving potential in large language models

Researchers have discovered that large language models internally assess their own likelihood of success before generating outputs. This breakthrough addresses a critical challenge in the field: efficiently allocating computational resources to problems that genuinely require them. The study demonstrates that these internal assessments, encoded within the modelsâ€™ pre-generation activations, can be accurately predicted using linear probes.

These probes substantially outperform traditional features like question length or term frequency-inverse document frequency in predictin

Text: AI Can Now â€˜knowâ€™ When Itâ€™s About To Fail Before Answering Questions

Researchers are increasingly focused on optimising the computational cost of large language models (LLMs) during complex reasoning tasks. William Lugoloobi, Thomas Foster, and William Bankes, from the University of Oxford and University College London, alongside Chris Russell et al., demonstrate that LLMs internally encode information about their likely success before generating an answer. This research is significant because it reveals that pre-generation activations can be used to predict performance on mathematical and other tasks, exceeding the predictive power of traditional features like question length. By analysing model performance on the E2H-AMC benchmark, the team show that LLMs develop a unique sense of difficulty, differing from human perception, and crucially, that this internal assessment improves with more extensive reasoning. Ultimately, they prove that utilising these internal signals allows for intelligent query routing, achieving performance gains of up to 70% cost reduction on the MATH dataset.

### Pre-generation activations reveal internal self-assessment of problem-solving potential in large language models

Researchers have discovered that large language models internally assess their own likelihood of success before generating outputs. This breakthrough addresses a critical challenge in the field: efficiently allocating computational resources to problems that genuinely require them. The study demonstrates that these internal assessments, encoded within the modelsâ€™ pre-generation activations, can be accurately predicted using linear probes.

These probes substantially outperform traditional features like question length or term frequency-inverse document frequency in predictin
