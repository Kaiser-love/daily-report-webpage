Just when I thought Iâ€™d grown immune to seeing huge numbers attached to the artificial intelligence business, Alphabet Inc. comes along with this:
$185 billion! Analysts had been expecting something more like $119.5 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data, which in itself would have been about a 30% increase from 2025. Now investors are being asked to swallow a potential spending increase of more than double.

# Claude Sonnet 5: Everything We Know About Anthropic&#39;s Fennec Model
2026-02-05
[claude] [anthropic] [ai-models] 
Anthropic has been steadily pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities, and their latest model represents a significant leap forward. Claude Sonnet 5, developed under the internal codename â€œFennec,â€ has officially launched on February 3, 2026, setting new benchmarks for coding AI performance while dramatically reducing costs.
## Release and Availability
Claude Sonnet 5 officially launched on February 3, 2026, with the model identifier`claude-sonnet-5-20260203`. The timing coincided with Super Bowl week, positioning Anthropic to capture maximum attention during one of the yearâ€™s biggest media events.
The model is available through:
* **Anthropic API**: Direct access for developers
* **Claude Pro**: Included in the $20/month subscription
* **Google Vertex AI**: Cloud platform integration## Benchmark Performance
Claude Sonnet 5 has achieved what many considered impossible just months agoâ€”surpassing the 82% threshold on SWE-Bench Verified:
|Model|SWE-Bench Score|
Claude Sonnet 5|82.1%|
Claude Opus 4.5|80.9%|
GPT-5|\~78% (estimated)|
Claude Opus 4|77.2%|
At 82.1%, Claude Sonnet 5 isnâ€™t just incrementally betterâ€”it represents a qualitative shift in what AI can accomplish. At this level, the model can take a raw bug report and independently write, test, and verify a patch that fixes the issue on the first try in the vast majority of cases.
## Pricing Revolution
Perhaps the most disruptive aspect of Sonnet 5 is its pricing structure:
|Model|Input (per 1M tokens)|Output (per 1M tokens)|
Claude Sonnet 5|$3.00|$15.00|

# Claude Sonnet 5: Everything We Know About Anthropic&#39;s Fennec Model
2026-02-05
[claude] [anthropic] [ai-models] 
Anthropic has been steadily pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities, and their latest model represents a significant leap forward. Claude Sonnet 5, developed under the internal codename â€œFennec,â€ has officially launched on February 3, 2026, setting new benchmarks for coding AI performance while dramatically reducing costs.
## Release and Availability
Claude Sonnet 5 officially launched on February 3, 2026, with the model identifier`claude-sonnet-5-20260203`. The timing coincided with Super Bowl week, positioning Anthropic to capture maximum attention during one of the yearâ€™s biggest media events.
The model is available through:
* **Anthropic API**: Direct access for developers
* **Claude Pro**: Included in the $20/month subscription
* **Google Vertex AI**: Cloud platform integration## Benchmark Performance
Claude Sonnet 5 has achieved what many considered impossible just months agoâ€”surpassing the 82% threshold on SWE-Bench Verified:
|Model|SWE-Bench Score|
Claude Sonnet 5|82.1%|
Claude Opus 4.5|80.9%|
GPT-5|\~78% (estimated)|
Claude Opus 4|77.2%|
At 82.1%, Claude Sonnet 5 isnâ€™t just incrementally betterâ€”it represents a qualitative shift in what AI can accomplish. At this level, the model can take a raw bug report and independently write, test, and verify a patch that fixes the issue on the first try in the vast majority of cases.
## Pricing Revolution
Perhaps the most disruptive aspect of Sonnet 5 is its pricing structure:
|Model|Input (per 1M tokens)|Output (per 1M tokens)|
Claude Sonnet 5|$3.00|$15.00|
